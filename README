Changes in this fork
====================

This fork is a work-in-progress for documenting open-source C# projects.

I've made a few changes to make it easier to run this python script without installing. You can now simply call:

python pycco/main.py src/*.cs


Necessary libraries are listed below (lifted directly from the code itself):

import optparse
import os
import pygments
import pystache
import re
import sys
import time
from markdown import markdown
from os import path
from pygments import lexers, formatters
from xml.dom import minidom


I'll endeavour to tidy things up and make this all more clear.
